This is a customizatin of the kinetic arm intended to be activable with much less strength than the original one.

One inconvenient of the Kinetic arm is that it requires some strength to be able to activate it, and this is mostly due to the paths followed by the wires having 4  right angles.

This design solves this issue, at the cost of the wrist rotation. The locking mechanism is no longer used in this design.

The fingers can be closed applying a weaker force that we can measure with a weight scale at about 270 grams (instead of 1kg or more for original design). This test was done using TPE Shore 83A hinges, and monothread nylon wire.

This is a work in progress, being evaluated. The silicon pad for the palm is not ready, all other parts are the normal parts of the Kinetic Arm (but no need for the locking mechanism).
